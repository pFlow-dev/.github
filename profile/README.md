## Introduction

This github organization contains all the repositories related
to the development of a petri-net based smart contract language.

## Reference Specification
* [pflow-js](https://github.com/pFlow-dev/pflow-js) - a javascript library
  * usable from the browser
  * considered to the *reference implementation*
   
* [metamodel-js](https://github.com/pFlow-dev/metamodel-js) - a typescript library
  * usable from npm
  * conforms to the reference implementation

## Current Focus

Advance the state of solidty smart contract development by
providing a library that can be used to create petri-net based
smart contracts.

## Future Focus

Deploy a smart contract based registry that can be used to
store and retrieve petri-net based smart contracts.

## Why Petri Nets?

Petri nets are a well known and well studied formalism that
can be used to model a wide variety of systems.

Petri nets are a natural fit for model development
because they are:

* simple
* expressive
* composable
* verifiable
