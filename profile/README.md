## Tools

Pflow is a Web3 SDK for Visual State Machines

The future vision for Pflow: building a hub for evolving composable contracts onchain.

- https://pflow.xyz/ - build Pflow models in the browser & export as Solidity
- https://app.pflow.xyz - interact with onchain Pflow Interfaces
- ipns://pflow.eth - app.pflow.xyz hosted on IPFS (WIP)

## Current Focus

Advance the state of solidity smart contract development by
providing a library that can be used to create petri-net based
smart contracts.

## Why Petri Nets?

Petri nets are a well known and well studied formalism that
can be used to model a wide variety of systems.

Petri nets are a natural fit for model development
because they are:

* simple
* expressive
* composable
* verifiable
