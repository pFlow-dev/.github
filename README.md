## Introduction

This github organization contains all the repositories related
to the development of a petri-net based smart contract language.

## Reference Specification

* pflow.js - a javascript library
  * usable from the browser
  * considered to the reference implementation
   
* metamodel-js - a typescript library
  * usable from npm
  * meant to conform to the reference implementation

## Current Focus

Advance the state of solidty smart contract development by
providing a library that can be used to create petri-net based
smart contracts.

## Future Focus

Deploy a smart contract based registry that can be used to
store and retrieve petri-net based smart contracts.

## Why Petri Nets?

Petri nets are a well known and well studied formalism that
can be used to model a wide variety of systems.

Petri nets are a natural fit for smart contract development
because they are:

* simple
* expressive
* composable
* verifiable

## Why Solidity?

Solidity is a natural fit for petri-net based smart contract due to the wide 
availability of tooling and the large developer community.
